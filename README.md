# Fibonacci
Taitotalo Python and Github training

Fibonacci.py was the first version I made for this course training. The software was working fine but after review I noted many improvements are needed.
Fibonacciv2.py is the second edition with same basic code. Fixed code a little bit and made it maybe a little bit more readible. More improvements still required.

Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program
generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.


In Fibonacci sequence you add 2 previous numbers to get the next number
(n-2) + (n-1) = (n)
for example -> 1 + 1 = 2 -> 1 + 2 = 3 -> 2 + 3 = 5 ->...
First 10 fibonacci numbers are: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34
