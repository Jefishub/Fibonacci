Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program
generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.


In Fibonacci sequence you add 2 previous numbers to get the next number
(n-2) + (n-1) = (n)
for example -> 1 + 1 = 2 -> 1 + 2 = 3 -> 2 + 3 = 5 ->...
First 10 fibonacci numbers are: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34
